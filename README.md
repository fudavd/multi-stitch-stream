# multi-stitch-stream
This repositories contains two main functionalities: 
1) Automated calibration and (multi) stitching of images/cameras. 
2) Multi-camera streaming interface using ZMQ. 
 
Both functionalities can be combined to aggregate several cameras online into a merged image which interfaces as a single camera stream.
